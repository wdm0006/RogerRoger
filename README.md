==========

A simple API to serve out health information for a running system. Optionally persists data into elasticsearch.  

Mostly a vehicle for learning about some new datastores and Scala.

TODO:

 * add endpoint to query recent data for a single metric
 * make simple page listing optional metrics
 * make js page for plotting that single metric
